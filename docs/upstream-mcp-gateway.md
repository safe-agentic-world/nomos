# Upstream MCP Gateway

Nomos can now run as an additive MCP governance gateway in front of one or more configured upstream MCP servers.

In this mode:

- the downstream agent still sees an MCP server
- Nomos remains the decision point
- governed upstream tools are surfaced as forwarded downstream tools
- successful calls are forwarded only after policy and approval checks pass

This is the 2026 MCP-native architecture path where:

- the agent is an MCP client
- business tools live on external MCP servers
- governance sits between the agent and those upstream MCP servers

## What v1 Supports

- configured upstream MCP servers over `stdio`, `streamable_http`, and legacy `sse`
- long-lived upstream MCP sessions: each upstream server is spawned once, initialized once, and reused for every forwarded call (no per-call process launch)
- id-keyed JSON-RPC response multiplexer so many concurrent forwarded calls share one upstream session
- `notifications/tools/list_changed` propagation so a refreshed upstream tool list is re-enumerated and re-advertised downstream without restarting Nomos
- deterministic restart-on-crash with bounded exponential backoff, fail-closed while restarting
- graceful shutdown: upstream child processes are terminated when the Nomos gateway exits
- standards-compatible upstream stdio interoperability with common newline-delimited JSON MCP server implementations
- compatibility fallback for framed upstream MCP responses when encountered
- deterministic downstream naming using a conservative cross-vendor-safe character set:
  - `upstream_<server>_<tool>`
- policy-visible forwarded action identity:
  - `action_type`: `mcp.call`
  - `resource`: `mcp://<server>/<tool>`
- governed non-tool MCP surfaces:
  - `mcp.resource_read`
  - `mcp.prompt_get`
  - `mcp.completion`
  - `mcp.sample` (default deny unless policy explicitly allows it)
- approval-gated forwarded calls using the same `approval_id` retry model as direct Nomos tools
- upstream stdio child processes run with an empty-by-default environment, plus only the explicitly allowlisted parent variables and declared per-server overrides

Out of scope for this first gateway mode:

- dynamic discovery or registry integration
- multi-hop MCP routing
- WebSocket upstream transport

## Config Example

Use the checked-in example:

- [examples/configs/config.mcp-gateway.example.json](../examples/configs/config.mcp-gateway.example.json)
- [examples/configs/config.mcp-gateway.remote-http.example.json](../examples/configs/config.mcp-gateway.remote-http.example.json)
- [examples/policies/mcp-gateway.example.yaml](../examples/policies/mcp-gateway.example.yaml)

Config shape:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "enabled": true,
    "breaker": {
      "enabled": true,
      "failure_threshold": 5,
      "failure_window_ms": 60000,
      "open_timeout_ms": 30000
    },
    "upstream_servers": [
      {
        "name": "retail",
        "transport": "stdio",
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["../local-tooling/retail_mcp_server.py"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `path/to/your/retail_mcp_server.py` with the upstream MCP server command you actually want Nomos to govern.

## Remote Upstream MCP Transports

Nomos can also front remote, managed, or containerized MCP servers over HTTP. Two transport kinds are supported:

- `streamable_http` — the current MCP Streamable HTTP transport. Nomos POSTs JSON-RPC messages to the configured endpoint and accepts either an `application/json` single response or a `text/event-stream` server-sent stream of JSON-RPC messages.
- `sse` — the legacy two-endpoint SSE transport. Nomos opens a `GET` SSE channel, receives the `endpoint` event, and POSTs subsequent messages to the advertised URL. Responses arrive back on the open SSE stream.

For `streamable_http`, Nomos speaks the current MCP HTTP transport version (`MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-11-25`), carries forward `MCP-Session-Id` when assigned by the upstream, listens on the optional GET event stream for server-initiated notifications, and sends a best-effort `DELETE` when closing a stateful HTTP session.

Both transports plug into the same long-lived session supervisor as `stdio`, so policy identity, approval semantics, forwarded tool naming, and audit records are identical across transports. A bundle that governs `mcp://retail/refund.request` does not need to change when the upstream `retail` server migrates from `stdio` to `streamable_http`.

Remote upstreams can also expose MCP resources, prompts, completions, and upstream-initiated sampling. Nomos governs those surfaces through the same normalization, policy, approval, redaction, and audit path used for tools:

- `resources/read` -> `mcp.resource_read`
- `prompts/get` -> `mcp.prompt_get`
- `completion/complete` -> `mcp.completion`
- `sampling/createMessage` -> `mcp.sample`

`mcp.sample` is intentionally fail-closed. If no rule matches, the downstream client's model is not invoked.

### HTTP Upstream Config Shape

The remote HTTP example above is a working template for `streamable_http` upstreams. The minimal shape is:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "enabled": true,
    "upstream_servers": [
      {
        "name": "retail",
        "transport": "streamable_http",
        "endpoint": "https://retail.mcp.example.com/mcp",
        "allowed_hosts": ["retail.mcp.example.com"],
        "auth": {
          "type": "bearer",
          "token": "${NOMOS_UPSTREAM_RETAIL_TOKEN}"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `endpoint` is required for `streamable_http` and `sse`. It must use `https` unless `tls_insecure` is set to `true`. `tls_insecure` is a dev-only escape hatch and MUST NOT be used in controlled runtimes.
- `allowed_hosts` is an optional host allowlist. When set, the upstream endpoint host (and, for legacy SSE, the advertised POST URL host) MUST match one of the listed hosts or startup fails closed before any RPC is sent.
- `tls_ca_file` is optional and adds a custom CA bundle for upstream TLS verification.
- `tls_cert_file` and `tls_key_file` are optional and enable mutual TLS to the upstream MCP server. They must be configured together.
- `auth` is an optional static auth injection hook. Supported shapes:
  - `{ "type": "bearer", "token": "..." }` → adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
  - `{ "type": "header", "header": "X-Api-Key", "value": "..." }` → adds a single static header.
  - `{ "type": "header", "values": { "X-Api-Key": "...", "X-Tenant": "..." } }` → adds multiple static headers.
- `credentials` is an optional brokered auth injection hook and is mutually exclusive with `auth`. It references `credentials.secrets[].id` by `profile` and supports `bearer`, `header`, `env`, and `file` injection modes.

Auth material passed through the config is injected only into upstream HTTP requests. It is NEVER written to audit records, explain output, or logs.

### Security Expectations

- TLS verification is on by default and uses the host's system root store. TLS verification failures during handshake, session startup, or call time cause the upstream session to fail closed; forwarded calls return `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` rather than silently downgrading.
- When `tls_ca_file` is set, Nomos extends the trust store with that CA bundle rather than disabling verification. When `tls_cert_file` and `tls_key_file` are set, Nomos presents that client certificate to upstream servers requiring mTLS.
- Upstream host allowlists are enforced **before** any JSON-RPC payload is sent. An allowlist violation prevents the upstream request entirely.
- Upstream auth failures (HTTP `401`/`403`) surface as deterministic `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` errors. Nomos does NOT retry with alternate credentials.
- Streamed responses are read through the normal redaction and per-rule `output_max_bytes` / `output_max_lines` caps before they leave Nomos to the agent, logs, or audit sinks. A streamed secret in a tool result is redacted the same as a buffered secret.
- Upstream stdio children do not inherit the parent process environment by default. If you need `PATH` or other process-level settings, add them explicitly through `env_allowlist` or `env`.

### Operator Guidance

- Prefer `https` endpoints with a trusted certificate chain. Reserve `tls_insecure` for local smoke tests against development servers.
- Prefer a private CA plus `tls_ca_file` over `tls_insecure` for internal upstreams, and use `tls_cert_file` plus `tls_key_file` only for upstreams that require client-authenticated TLS.
- Set `allowed_hosts` to the exact hostnames you intend to forward to. This is a transport-layer allowlist, not a substitute for a policy rule — the policy bundle is still the only authorization source.
- Prefer brokered upstream credentials over static `auth` tokens. Brokered leases are bound to the principal, upstream server, and session id; audit records contain lease IDs only.
- Policy bundles do not need any changes to move an upstream from `stdio` to `streamable_http`: `mcp.call` resource identity is `mcp://<server>/<tool>` regardless of transport.

### Upstream Timeouts

M50 adds per-stage upstream deadlines so a slow or hung server fails closed instead of stalling Nomos:

- `initialize_timeout_ms`
- `enumerate_timeout_ms`
- `call_timeout_ms`
- `stream_timeout_ms`

Default budgets are conservative and can be overridden globally under `mcp.timeouts` or per upstream server under `mcp.upstream_servers[].timeouts`.

Recommended tuning:

- keep `initialize` and `enumerate` short, because they gate startup and tool discovery
- give `call` a larger budget than `enumerate` for expensive tools, but keep it bounded
- set `stream` only as high as necessary for long-lived SSE subscriptions, because each read still uses a bounded per-read deadline

Timeout and cancellation failures are explicit:

- `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` means the upstream did not respond before the configured deadline
- `UPSTREAM_CANCELED` means the downstream request was canceled before the upstream completed
- both are fail-closed and are not retried silently

### Upstream Circuit Breakers

Nomos tracks a deterministic circuit breaker per upstream session. The breaker has three active states:

- `closed`: calls are forwarded normally
- `open`: calls fail fast with `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`
- `half-open`: one in-flight probe is allowed after the open timeout expires

Breaker defaults are safe for shared gateways:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "breaker": {
      "enabled": true,
      "failure_threshold": 5,
      "failure_window_ms": 60000,
      "open_timeout_ms": 30000
    }
  }
}
```

You can override those values per upstream with `mcp.upstream_servers[].breaker`. Set `enabled` to `false` globally or for one upstream to return to the previous restart/backoff-only behavior.

Transport failures, protocol errors, and timeouts contribute to the breaker window. Upstream application-level JSON-RPC errors do not trip the breaker on their own, because those are valid tool outcomes rather than evidence that the transport is unhealthy.

Recovery requires a successful half-open probe. The timer only allows the probe; it does not close the breaker by itself. While the breaker is open, Nomos does not return stale cached responses and does not re-run policy decisions. The already-allowed forwarded call is short-circuited before upstream forwarding, with policy semantics unchanged.

Operator signals:

- `nomos doctor` reports the configured initial breaker state for each upstream
- telemetry emits `mcp.upstream_breaker.transition` events when an upstream moves between states
- the downstream MCP response error is `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` while the breaker is open

### Argument Schema Validation

Forwarded `tools/call` arguments are validated at the Nomos boundary against the upstream tool's advertised `inputSchema` before policy evaluation and before any upstream forwarding.

Nomos uses an embedded JSON Schema validator pinned to draft 2020-12 semantics. If an upstream omits `inputSchema`, forwarded calls fail closed with `ARGUMENT_VALIDATION_ERROR` unless that upstream explicitly opts in:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "upstream_servers": [
      {
        "name": "legacy",
        "transport": "stdio",
        "command": "legacy-mcp-server",
        "allow_missing_tool_schemas": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Validation failures are deterministic and do not echo raw argument values into responses, audit, explain output, telemetry, or logs. Internally, Nomos records only bounded error shape (`path`, `expected`, `actual kind`) and returns the stable downstream error code `ARGUMENT_VALIDATION_ERROR`.

Validated arguments are canonicalized with the same canonical JSON primitive used for action fingerprints. The `mcp.call` action params include:

- `tool_arguments`: canonicalized argument object
- `tool_arguments_hash`: SHA-256 of the canonical argument object
- `tool_schema_validated`: whether an upstream schema was enforced

This means two calls with the same logical arguments but different JSON key order produce the same action fingerprint and approval binding. The validator also enforces argument byte, depth, and node limits so crafted arguments cannot force unbounded validation work.

### Tool Definition Pinning

An upstream MCP server can change what a tool does after you approved it: the same tool name comes back from `tools/list` with a new description or a new `inputSchema`, typically announced through `notifications/tools/list_changed`. Nomos pins the definition of every forwarded tool and refuses calls whose live definition no longer matches the pin until an operator accepts the change.

The definition hash is the hex SHA-256 of the canonical JSON of `{"name", "description", "inputSchema"}` exactly as the upstream advertised it (`inputSchema` is omitted when the upstream sends none). Key order and whitespace of the upstream payload do not change the hash; any change to the description or the schema does.

Pins live in a sidecar JSON file configured under `upstream.tool_pins`:

```json
{
  "upstream": {
    "tool_pins": {
      "file": "./upstream-tool-pins.json",
      "mode": "record"
    }
  }
}
```

- `file` resolves relative to the config file directory, like every other filesystem-backed config field, and defaults to `upstream-tool-pins.json` next to the config.
- `mode` is one of:
  - `record` (default): trust on first sight. The first forwarded call to a tool pins its current definition; later calls are denied when the definition changed.
  - `strict`: a tool without a pin is refused, so the pin file must be populated with `nomos mcp pins accept` before a tool can be called.
  - `off`: no pinning; the file is neither read nor written.

Any other mode value is a config error. The pin file format is:

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "pins": {
    "retail/refund.request": {
      "definition_hash": "<hex sha256>",
      "pinned_at": "2026-09-26T12:00:00Z",
      "name": "refund.request",
      "description": "Submit a retail refund request."
    }
  }
}
```

Keys are `<server>/<tool>` and unknown fields are rejected. A pin file that cannot be read or parsed is a startup (and reload) error. In `record` mode a pin that cannot be written makes the call fail closed with the `TOOL_PIN_STORE_ERROR` error instead of proceeding. Writes go through an atomic temp-file rename, and the gateway re-reads the file when it changes on disk, so pins accepted or removed with the CLI take effect without a restart.

The check runs on every forwarded call before argument validation, policy, and approvals, including after a `notifications/tools/list_changed` refresh: a changed definition is caught on the next call and is never re-pinned silently. A refusal is a normal `DENY` decision (no upstream call is made, and the `tools/call` result has the same shape as any policy deny) with one of these reason codes:

- `deny_by_tool_definition_change`: a pin exists and the live definition hash differs from it
- `deny_by_unpinned_tool_definition`: `strict` mode and no pin exists for the tool

Every pin decision writes an `mcp.tool_definition_pin` audit event whose `executor_metadata` carries `upstream_server`, `upstream_tool`, `tool_definition_hash` (live), `tool_definition_pinned_hash` (when a pin exists), `tool_pin_mode`, and `tool_pin_file`; `result_classification` is `PINNED`, `DENIED_TOOL_DEFINITION`, or `TOOL_PIN_STORE_ERROR`. The `mcp.call` action params also include `tool_definition_hash` and, when a pin exists, `tool_definition_pinned_hash`, so `nomos policy explain` and the `action.*` audit records show which definition a call was evaluated against and `params_match` rules can key on it.

Operator flow after a `deny_by_tool_definition_change`:

1. Review the new definition on the upstream server. The audit event carries the live hash and the pinned hash.
2. Accept it: `nomos mcp pins accept retail/refund.request -c ./config.json`. This connects to the upstream with the same session code the gateway uses, enumerates the tool, rewrites the pin to the live hash, and prints the previous and new hashes. Pass `--hash <sha256>` to pin exactly the hash you reviewed (for example the `tool_definition_hash` from the audit event) without connecting.
3. `nomos mcp pins list -c ./config.json` shows every pin; `nomos mcp pins remove retail/refund.request -c ./config.json` forgets one, after which `record` mode pins the next call again.

Keep the pin file under version control next to the policy bundle: it is the record of which tool definitions your operators accepted.

### Environment Isolation

Nomos now isolates upstream stdio processes from the parent environment by default. For each upstream server:

- `env_allowlist` copies named variables from the Nomos parent environment, if present
- `env` injects explicit key/value overrides and wins over allowlisted parent values
- the constructed child environment is sorted deterministically before launch
- audit metadata records an `upstream_env_shape_hash` so operators can compare the shape of the environment without exposing values

Migration note:

- if you previously relied on inherited parent environment variables, move those names into `env_allowlist` and add any fixed overrides to `env`
- if a stdio upstream command is not an absolute path and the env is empty, Nomos emits a startup warning because the child may not have a usable `PATH`


Policy shape:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: require-approval-upstream-refund
    action_type: mcp.call
    resource: mcp://retail/request_refund
    decision: REQUIRE_APPROVAL
```

## Forwarded Tool Naming

If the upstream server is named `retail` and it exposes a tool named `request_refund`, Nomos advertises:

- `upstream_retail_request_refund`

That tool maps deterministically to:

- `action_type`: `mcp.call`
- `resource`: `mcp://retail/request_refund`

Only the client-facing forwarded tool name is adapted for broad MCP client and model-provider compatibility. Policy, approvals, explain, and audit continue to key off the canonical `mcp://<server>/<tool>` resource identity.

## How Forwarding Works

1. the downstream agent calls a forwarded MCP tool exposed by Nomos
2. Nomos constructs a governed `mcp.call` action
3. normalization, policy, approvals, redaction, and audit run on the Nomos path
4. only an `ALLOW` result causes the upstream MCP tool call to be forwarded over the long-lived upstream session
5. the upstream tool result is returned through the governed response path as `execution_mode: mcp_forwarded`

## Upstream Session Lifecycle

Nomos runs one long-lived supervisor per configured upstream MCP server. At startup:

1. the supervisor spawns the upstream child process
2. it runs `initialize` and `notifications/initialized` exactly once
3. it calls `tools/list` to populate the forwarded tool registry
4. it begins accepting forwarded calls over the same session

Every subsequent forwarded call reuses the same upstream session, so latency is dominated by policy evaluation and upstream tool execution — not by process startup. JSON-RPC request ids are allocated deterministically per session and multiplexed by a single reader goroutine, so many concurrent forwarded calls are routed back to their original callers without cross-talk.

When the upstream server emits `notifications/tools/list_changed`, the supervisor re-enumerates the upstream tool list and refreshes the downstream forwarded tool set. No Nomos restart is required. Unknown or unsupported upstream notifications are logged deterministically and dropped without affecting policy decisions already in flight.

## Upstream Unavailable Behavior

If the upstream process crashes, closes stdin/stdout, or sends an unframable response, the session is marked unavailable. All in-flight forwarded calls bound to that session return a structured `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` error to the caller. Policy decisions already recorded in audit are not re-executed.

The next forwarded call triggers a lazy session restart with bounded exponential backoff, unless the upstream breaker is open. While a restart is pending or the breaker is open, additional forwarded calls return `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` rather than hanging, so failures stay deterministic and fail-closed.

You will see `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` surface in:

- the downstream MCP response `error` field for the failing forwarded tool call
- audit and explain output when the forwarded call reaches the supervisor after policy has allowed it

This is distinct from a policy `DENY`: `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` means policy allowed the forwarded call but the upstream transport was not in a usable state at the moment of execution. Retry by the client, not a policy change, is the appropriate operator response.

## Approval Retry

Forwarded tools use the same approval pattern as other Nomos-mediated actions:

1. first call returns `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` with `approval_id`
2. operator records approval
3. client retries the same forwarded tool with:

```json
{
  "approval_id": "apr_..."
}
```

Nomos then re-evaluates and only forwards on a valid approved retry.

## Notes

- Upstream tool enumeration fails closed. If Nomos cannot initialize an upstream server or list its tools, startup fails.
- Upstream stdio compatibility failures are reported with stage-aware errors such as launch, initialize, tool enumeration, or tool invocation.
- Nomos expects real upstream MCP stdio servers to follow ecosystem-standard newline-delimited JSON messaging. Framed upstream responses are also accepted for compatibility.
- Direct Nomos MCP tools still work unchanged. Upstream gateway mode is additive.
- Stateful upstream MCP servers that rely on session-scoped state (auth tokens, cached resources, progress streams) work correctly because the upstream session is long-lived rather than re-initialized per call.
- Upstream child processes are terminated on Nomos shutdown. Supervised deployments should additionally parent the Nomos process to a process manager that reaps orphans on a host crash.
- Upstream stderr is continuously drained; the tail of stderr is attached to stage-aware error messages when an upstream process fails to launch or handshake.
- `nomos.capabilities` includes a `forwarded_tools` section when upstream MCP servers are configured.
- `nomos.capabilities` also includes an `mcp_surfaces` section describing policy state for `resource_read`, `prompt_get`, `completion`, and `sample`.
