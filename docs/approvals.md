# Approval Binding Model

Nomos binds approvals to deterministic targets so an approval for one normalized input is not valid for a different normalized input.

## Fingerprint

This applies to the default `fingerprint` scope. Optional `class` approvals
are deliberately broader and do not bind individual argument values.

`action_fingerprint = sha256(canonical_json({normalized_action, principal, agent, environment}))`

`normalized_action` includes:
- `schema_version`
- `action_type`
- `resource`
- canonicalized `params`

Any change to normalized inputs (including params) produces a new fingerprint
and requires a new fingerprint-scoped approval.

## MCP Argument Preview

For approval-gated `mcp.call` actions, approval records include an `argument_preview_json` payload.

The preview is derived from the normalized canonical `params.tool_arguments` field, the same canonical params blob used for `action_fingerprint` and `params_hash`.

Preview guarantees:

- only `mcp.call` approvals include argument previews; non-MCP approvals are unchanged
- secrets are redacted before storage and rendering
- known sensitive argument fields such as authorization, cookies, tokens, API keys, passwords, credentials, and private keys are replaced with `[REDACTED]`
- previews are size-capped and mark `truncated: true` when Nomos cannot safely render the full argument shape
- `tool_arguments_hash` and `params_hash` remain visible so operators can bind what they see to the canonical action that will execute

Approval previews are presentation data only. Operator UI, CLI, and explain rendering do not re-evaluate policy and do not provide an alternate execution path.

Native client approvals are outside this model. A Codex or Claude prompt that asks the user to approve a native shell, file, HTTP, patch, or git action is not bound to Nomos' action fingerprint and does not satisfy a Nomos `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` decision.

## Scope

Nomos supports two narrowly scoped bindings:
- `fingerprint` (default): a single normalized action.
- `class` (optional): bounded class key currently limited to `action_type_resource`, derived as `<action_type>|<resource>`.

Approvals are never global.

## Resume Flow

1. Policy returns `REQUIRE_APPROVAL`.
2. Nomos durably persists a pending approval with TTL, including a redacted MCP argument preview when the action is `mcp.call`.
3. External approver records `APPROVE` or `DENY` via approval endpoint/webhook.
4. Agent retries the same action with `context.extensions.approval = {"approval_id":"..."}`.
5. Nomos recomputes normalized action and fingerprint and only resumes when approval binding matches and TTL is valid.

## Integrations

`POST /approvals/decide` and `POST /api/ui/approvals/decide` require principal
authentication and membership in `approvals.approver_principals`. An empty
list authorizes nobody. Use a separate reviewer token; do not give the agent
access to that client. These endpoints authenticate the reviewer principal,
not the agent HMAC, and retain tenant-scope checks where tenancy is enabled.

```json
{"approvals": {"enabled": true, "approver_principals": ["reviewer"]}}
```

This is a configuration fragment; also configure the reviewer identity and
durable store. Existing installations must add an explicit reviewer list
before remote approval decisions will work.

Nomos provides integration endpoints:
- Generic webhook: `POST /webhooks/approvals` requires `X-Nomos-Webhook-Token`.
- Slack webhook: `POST /webhooks/slack/approvals` requires `X-Nomos-Slack-Token`.
- Teams webhook: `POST /webhooks/teams/approvals` requires `X-Nomos-Teams-Token`.

Each route is disabled (404) unless its own token is configured. These are
trusted relay endpoints, not native Slack/Teams signature-verification
integrations. A token holder is an approval authority; keep tokens outside
agent access. The separate reviewer allowlist applies to principal-auth
endpoints, not these token-authenticated relays.

Slack payload schema:
- `approval_id` (string, required)
- `decision` (string, required)
- `user_id` (string, required)
- `channel_id` (string, required)
- `comment` (string, optional)

Teams payload schema:
- `approval_id` (string, required)
- `decision` (string, required)
- `user_aad_id` (string, required)
- `conversation_id` (string, required)
- `comment` (string, optional)

Unknown fields are rejected for deterministic validation behavior.

## Durable Store

Approvals are persisted before Nomos returns a pending, approved, or denied state to a client or operator.

Configured gateway deployments use the file-backed store by default:

```json
{
  "approvals": {
    "enabled": true,
    "backend": "file",
    "store_path": "nomos-approvals.json",
    "ttl_seconds": 900
  }
}
```

Supported backends:

- `file`: default durable JSON store with checksum validation and atomic writes.
- `sqlite`: optional SQLite store for operators that prefer a database file.

SQLite configuration:

```json
{
  "approvals": {
    "enabled": true,
    "backend": "sqlite",
    "store_path": "nomos-approvals.db",
    "ttl_seconds": 900
  }
}
```

Durability semantics:

- startup verifies persisted store integrity before serving approvals
- expired approvals are purged deterministically on startup and pending-list reads
- TTL checks survive process restarts because `expires_at` is persisted
- partial file-store writes are isolated in a temporary file and do not replace the last committed store
- existing approval ids, fingerprints, scopes, and approval resume behavior are stable across file and SQLite backends

Migration from older deployments:

1. If approvals were disabled or no durable store path was configured, enable approvals and set `approvals.store_path`.
2. For the default backend, use `backend: "file"` and a path such as `nomos-approvals.json`.
3. To keep an existing SQLite approval database, set `backend: "sqlite"` and point `store_path` at the existing `.db` file.
4. Keep `ttl_seconds` at least as long as the previous approval TTL window.
5. Restart Nomos and verify `nomos approvals list --store <path> --backend <file|sqlite>` and a non-production `approve` / `deny` decision before routing approval-gated actions.

## Approval CLI

Direct store access is trusted operator access and bypasses HTTP reviewer
authentication. Do not grant an agent filesystem access to approval stores.

Operators can inspect pending approvals with:

```bash
nomos approvals list --store ./nomos-approvals.json --backend file
nomos approvals list --store ./nomos-approvals.db --backend sqlite
```

The JSON output includes `argument_preview` for `mcp.call` approvals and omits it for non-MCP approvals.

Operators can decide a pending approval from the same durable store:

```bash
nomos approvals approve --store ./nomos-approvals.json --backend file <approval_id>
nomos approvals deny --store ./nomos-approvals.json --backend file <approval_id>
```

`approve` and `deny` accept `--format text|json`. The `approval_id` may appear before or after the flags.

## Params Patch (Future)

Approval IDs are not single-use execution tokens. Replaying an approved
action can run a custom tool again. Use provider idempotency keys and durable
workflow checkpoints; see [the SDK guide](http-sdk.md).

Approvals may optionally provide a params patch in a future revision. If applied, it creates a new normalized action and fingerprint, which requires approval against that new target.
