# Integration Kit

This guide covers local agent integration for Nomos using checked-in quickstart files, MCP stdio mode, and the official HTTP SDK adoption layer.

Unless otherwise stated, the examples here show how to route actions through Nomos. They do not, by themselves, prove full mediation in unmanaged local environments.

The checked-in configs and policy bundles referenced here are examples only. In real deployments, teams are expected to supply and customize their own configs and policies.

`examples/configs/config.example.json` demonstrates ordered multi-bundle loading with `base.yaml`, `repo.yaml`, `dev.yaml`, and `purchase.yaml`.

If you are starting from a fresh machine, install Nomos first:

```powershell
go install ./cmd/nomos
```

Shared quickstart assets used below:

- [config.quickstart.json](../examples/quickstart/config.quickstart.json)
- [safe.yaml](../examples/policies/safe.yaml)
- [allow-readme.json](../examples/quickstart/actions/allow-readme.json)
- [deny-env.json](../examples/quickstart/actions/deny-env.json)

## Codex Setup

1. Run a preflight check:

```powershell
nomos.exe doctor -c .\examples\quickstart\config.quickstart.json --format json
```

2. Start the MCP server:

```powershell
nomos.exe mcp -c .\examples\quickstart\config.quickstart.json
```

3. Register Nomos in Codex MCP configuration with the checked-in example:

- [codex.mcp.json](../examples/local-tooling/codex.mcp.json)

4. In Codex, issue one allowed and one denied request:

- allowed: ask to read `README.md` from the quickstart workspace
- denied: ask to read `.env` from the quickstart workspace

Expected behavior:

- `README.md` succeeds under `allow-root-markdown`
- `.env` is denied under `deny-root-env`

Troubleshooting:

- if MCP registration fails, confirm the command uses the current `mcp -c ...` example and not stale flags
- if actions are denied unexpectedly, confirm Codex is targeting `examples/quickstart/workspace`
- if you see no startup banner, check whether `--quiet` is set

## Claude Code Setup

1. Run the same preflight:

```powershell
nomos.exe doctor -c .\examples\quickstart\config.quickstart.json --format json
```

2. Start the MCP server:

```powershell
nomos.exe mcp -c .\examples\quickstart\config.quickstart.json
```

3. Register Nomos using the checked-in example:

- [claude-code-mcp.json](../examples/local-tooling/claude-code-mcp.json)

4. In Claude Code, run the same two requests using canonical Nomos file resources:

- allowed: read `file://workspace/README.md`
- denied: read `file://workspace/.env`

M41 shorthand note:

- for `nomos.fs_read` and `nomos.fs_write`, common workspace-relative inputs such as `README.md`, `./README.md`, `.env`, or `src/app.py` are now accepted and adapted to canonical `file://workspace/...` resources
- policy, explain, and audit still operate on the canonical normalized resource
- absolute host paths and traversal attempts remain rejected

Troubleshooting:

- if Claude Code cannot connect, verify the MCP command path points to `nomos`
- if the wrong workspace is used, confirm the config file is [config.quickstart.json](../examples/quickstart/config.quickstart.json)
- if startup fails while loading `examples/policies/safe.yaml`, your installed `nomos` release may be older than the policy language used by the current repo
- if a file read still returns `normalization_error`, retry with a workspace-relative path like `README.md` or the explicit canonical form `file://workspace/README.md`
- in unmanaged local sessions, disable direct built-in file tools if you want Nomos to be the practical side-effect boundary

## OpenAI-Compatible Agent SDK Setup

Use the runnable local HTTP example:

- [nomos_http_loop.py](../examples/openai-compatible/nomos_http_loop.py)
- [http-sdk.md](./http-sdk.md)

1. Start Nomos:

```powershell
nomos.exe serve -c .\examples\quickstart\config.quickstart.json
```

2. In a second terminal, run:

```powershell
python .\examples\openai-compatible\nomos_http_loop.py
```

What it demonstrates:

- a tool loop sending one governed action that returns `ALLOW`
- a second governed action that returns `DENY`
- deterministic handling of both responses over the HTTP API
- the same HTTP path can now be wrapped with the official SDKs instead of handwritten headers and envelopes

For wrapper-based integration patterns that let you guard one tool at a time, see:

- [docs/http-sdk.md](./http-sdk.md)
- [docs/integration-patterns.md](./integration-patterns.md)

Troubleshooting:

- if the script returns `401`, use the default checked-in key `dev-api-key`
- if the script returns `connection refused`, start `nomos serve` first
- if you want to point the example at a different host, set `NOMOS_BASE_URL`

## OpenClaw Setup

OpenClaw uses the same MCP stdio contract.

1. Start Nomos with the checked-in multi-bundle example config:

```powershell
nomos mcp -c .\examples\configs\config.example.json
```

2. Register Nomos in OpenClaw MCP server config with command `nomos` and args:
- `mcp`
- `-c`
- `.\examples\configs\config.example.json`

If you want to override the checked-in example policy set, add:
- `-p`
- `.\examples\policies\your-policy-bundle.json`

## MCP Runtime UX

MCP mode keeps stdout protocol-only. Human-readable status/logs are written to stderr.

New flags:
- `--log-level error|warn|info|debug` (default `info`)
- `--log-format text|json` (default `text`)
- `--quiet` (equivalent to error-only; suppresses startup banner)

Default MCP runtime output behavior:
- one ready banner line on stderr after startup
- errors on stderr
- no non-protocol text on stdout

## CLI Ergonomics

`nomos mcp` now supports short aliases and env fallbacks with deterministic precedence.

Short flags:
- `-c` for `--config`
- `-p` for `--policy-bundle`
- `-l` for `--log-level`
- `-q` for `--quiet`

Env fallbacks:
- `NOMOS_CONFIG`
- `NOMOS_POLICY_BUNDLE`
- `NOMOS_LOG_LEVEL`

Precedence:
1. explicit CLI flag
2. environment variable
3. fail closed

Example:

```powershell
nomos mcp -c .\examples\configs\config.example.json -p .\examples\policies\your-policy-bundle.json -l info
```

Use `-p` here only when you intentionally want to override the example config's bundled policy paths.

## Doctor Preflight

Use `nomos doctor` before connecting MCP clients to validate configuration and runtime readiness.

Examples:

```powershell
nomos doctor -c .\examples\configs\config.example.json
nomos doctor -c .\examples\configs\config.example.json --format json
```

Exit codes:
- `0` READY
- `1` NOT_READY
- `2` INTERNAL_ERROR

## MCP Config Examples

### Example: Generic MCP client JSON

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nomos": {
      "command": "nomos",
      "args": [
        "mcp",
        "-c",
        ".\\examples\\configs\\config.example.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example: Strict approvals-enabled config fragment

```json
{
  "approvals": {
    "enabled": true,
    "store_path": ".\\nomos-approvals.db",
    "ttl_seconds": 900,
    "webhook_token": "replace-me"
  }
}
```

## Capabilities Explanation

Use `nomos.capabilities` to discover the current advisory capability contract for a principal/agent/environment under loaded policy.

Response fields:
- `enabled_tools`: backward-compatible union of all currently usable or approval-gated tools.
- `immediate_tools`: tools with at least one policy path callable now without approval.
- `approval_gated_tools`: tools that are only available through approval-gated policy paths.
- `mixed_tools`: tools where some policy paths are callable now and others require approval.
- `unavailable_tools`: tools advertised through MCP but not currently authorized for this identity context.
- `advertised_tools`: the static MCP `tools/list` surface.
- `tool_states`: per-tool machine-readable state (`allow`, `require_approval`, `mixed`, `unavailable`) plus immediate-callable and approval-required flags.
- `contract_version`: explicit capability contract version.
- `capability_set_hash`: deterministic hash of the surfaced capability contract for the current identity and runtime.
- `advisory_only`: always `true`; capability surfacing is not an authorization result.
- `authorization_notice`: reminder that live action authorization remains authoritative.
- `tool_states[*].constraints`: bounded safe summaries such as resource classes, host classes, exec classes, and approval scope classes.
- `tool_advertisement_mode`: how MCP tool advertisement relates to effective policy state. Current value: `mcp_tools_list_static`.
- `sandbox_modes`: available sandbox mode envelope (`none` or `sandboxed` in current implementation).
- `network_mode`: `deny` or `allowlist` depending on policy-derived capability.
- `output_max_bytes`, `output_max_lines`: output caps returned to the client.
- `approvals_enabled`: whether approval workflow is configured.
- `assurance_level`: runtime-derived assurance label for the current mediation environment.
- `mediation_notice`: human-readable warning when the current runtime is not strong mediation.

MCP surfacing semantics:

- `tools/list` remains static for compatibility and always advertises the full Nomos tool surface.
- `nomos.capabilities` is the authoritative advisory contract for client UX, not for authorization.
- final authorization is still performed per action with deny-wins semantics.
- clients should treat `capability_set_hash` changes as a cue to refresh UI state, not as a bypass of live authorization.

## Unmanaged Laptop Limitations And Safe Workflows

In unmanaged developer laptops, mediation is best-effort. Nomos cannot guarantee that all side effects are forced through the gateway.

Safe workflow recommendations:
1. Keep policy deny-by-default and only allow required actions.
2. Require approvals for high-risk actions (`process.exec`, `net.http_request`, writes/patches in sensitive paths).
3. Use publish-boundary validation (`repo.validate_change_set`) before creating PRs.
4. Keep audit enabled (`stdout` + `sqlite`) and review `action.completed` events.
5. Avoid local direct credentials; pass only lease IDs in policy/executor metadata.

Operational note:
- Stronger enforcement guarantees are expected in controlled runtimes (`ci`, containers, and `k8s` runners).
- In local Claude Code or similar unmanaged setups, disable direct built-in file/shell tools if you want Nomos to be the only practical side-effect path.
- See `docs/assurance-levels.md` for the current assurance labels and mediation coverage exposed in audit and `nomos policy explain`.
