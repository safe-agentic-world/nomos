# Policy Explain

This document defines the `nomos policy explain` output contract.

## Purpose

`nomos policy explain` provides deterministic, operator-safe denial context without exposing raw secrets or sensitive policy internals.

## Output Fields

- `decision`
- `reason_code`
- `matched_rule_ids`
- `policy_bundle_hash`
- `policy_bundle_sources` (multi-bundle only)
- `policy_bundle_inputs` (multi-bundle only)
- `matched_rule_provenance` (when rules matched)
- `engine_version`
- `assurance_level`
- `obligations_preview`
- `exec_authorization` (`process.exec` only)
- `argument_preview` (`mcp.call` only)

For non-allow outcomes, Nomos also emits:

- `why_denied`
- `minimal_allowing_change` (unless disabled by config)

## why_denied

`why_denied` contains:

- `reason_code`: the top-level denial reason
- `deny_rules`: the deny rule IDs that caused a deny-wins outcome
- `matched_conditions`: a safe, boolean-only summary
- `remediation_hint`: a deterministic human-readable hint

`deny_rules` entries contain:

- `rule_id`
- `reason_code`
- `matched_conditions`
- `bundle_source` (multi-bundle only)

`policy_bundle_sources` is emitted only when Nomos evaluated a merged multi-bundle policy set.

It preserves the ordered bundle provenance as `path#hash` labels so operators can identify which inputs produced the effective merged policy state.

`policy_bundle_inputs` provides the structured ordered inputs for the same merged policy set:

- `path`
- `hash`
- `role` when configured
- `signature_verified` when bundle verification was enabled

`matched_rule_provenance` provides a safe rule-to-bundle map:

- `rule_id`
- `decision`
- `bundle_source` (multi-bundle only)

This lets operators answer which bundle contributed each matched rule without exposing raw action params or other sensitive request material.

The matched-condition view is intentionally limited to booleans. It does not echo request params, headers, tokens, or other raw inputs.

## obligations_preview

`obligations_preview` shows the merged obligations that would apply on the applicable non-deny path:

- for `ALLOW`, the merged allow obligations
- for `REQUIRE_APPROVAL`, the merged approval obligations
- for `DENY`, the merged allow obligations that would apply if the deny outcome were removed, if any

## exec_authorization

For `process.exec`, Nomos emits an `exec_authorization` object with:

- `condition_class`
- `runtime_enforcement_hint`
- `compatibility_mode`
- `conflict`

This keeps exec explain output explicit without exposing raw argv payloads or broader policy internals.

## argument_preview

For `mcp.call`, Nomos emits the same redacted canonical argument preview used by approval records.

The preview is derived from normalized `params.tool_arguments`, includes `tool_arguments_hash` and `params_hash`, and is size-capped. It is informational only; explain output does not create approvals, execute actions, or re-evaluate a modified request.

## minimal_allowing_change

This field is a deterministic remediation suggestion.

Rules:

- derived from normalized action shape and policy outcome only
- safe to expose in CI logs
- may be disabled via `policy.explain_suggestions: false`

## Stability

- field set is deterministic for the same inputs
- map content is stable under Go's JSON encoding rules
- output must remain safe for CI assertions
