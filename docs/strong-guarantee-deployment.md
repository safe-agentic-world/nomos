# Strong-Guarantee Deployment

This is the golden path for a reproducible strong-guarantee deployment of Nomos.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- a Kubernetes cluster that enforces `NetworkPolicy`
- a TLS secret named `nomos-tls`
- a Nomos image available as `nomos:local` or an equivalent image override
- a runtime where the operator controls network, identity, and pod security settings

If the cluster does not enforce `NetworkPolicy`, this deployment does **not** provide a strong guarantee.

## Kubernetes Golden Path

1. Build the image:

```bash
go build -o ./bin/nomos ./cmd/nomos
docker build -t nomos:local .
```

2. Apply the single reference manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/strong-guarantee.yaml
```

The manifest deploys:

- the Nomos gateway
- a locked-down `sample-agent` pod
- a Nomos-only egress policy for the sample agent
- a restricted Nomos egress policy for approved upstream access

3. Confirm health:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=nomos
kubectl get pods -l app=sample-agent
kubectl get networkpolicy nomos-egress
kubectl get networkpolicy sample-agent-egress
```

4. Run doctor against the strong-guarantee config:

```bash
go run ./cmd/nomos doctor -c ./examples/configs/config.example.json --format json
```

The strong-guarantee readiness signal is intentionally conservative. For a deployment to be READY, the config should indicate:

- `runtime.strong_guarantee=true`
- `runtime.deployment_mode=k8s` (or `ci` in CI environments)
- `executor.sandbox_profile=container`
- gateway mTLS enabled
- workload identity verification enabled
- shared API keys disabled
- durable audit sink configured

5. Verify the outer boundary from the sample agent:

Direct egress to arbitrary hosts should fail:

```bash
kubectl exec deploy/sample-agent -- wget -T 5 -qO- https://example.com || true
```

Access to the Nomos service should remain possible:

```bash
kubectl exec deploy/sample-agent -- wget -T 5 -qO- http://nomos:8080/healthz
```

The sample agent should not have an automounted service account token:

```bash
kubectl exec deploy/sample-agent -- sh -c 'test ! -e /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'
```

The sample agent should run as non-root:

```bash
kubectl exec deploy/sample-agent -- id -u
```

The expected result is a non-zero UID.

## CI Golden Path

Use the reference workflow in `deploy/ci/github-actions-hardened.yml` as the hardened baseline:

- Nomos is the policy gate for governed actions
- `nomos doctor` runs in strong-guarantee mode before agent tasks begin
- workload identity should come from the CI platform identity provider rather than long-lived shared keys

The checked-in CI example validates the strong-guarantee config shape and readiness signals. It is still the operator's job to ensure the CI runtime enforces the outer network and credential boundary.

## Operational Expectations

- Direct agent egress is blocked by runtime network policy.
- The sample agent can only egress to the Nomos gateway on TCP 8080.
- Enterprise identity is asserted by the platform.
- Agent-visible effects occur only through Nomos-mediated actions.
- Denied bypass attempts are auditable.

## Scope

This provides a reference deployment, a reusable validation harness, and conservative readiness checks.

It does not claim:

- a full proof for every Kubernetes distribution
- enforcement on unmanaged developer machines
- complete mediation outside operator-controlled runtimes

Treat this document as the source of truth for what the current strong-guarantee reference actually enforces.
